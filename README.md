# timeConverter


## INTRODUCTION 

Our Mobile programming subject teachers told us to code a **_time converter**_ app in Android Studio.

This project was made by couples, which provided us to have a better progress making all the requirements that they wanted. 


## APP DESCRIPTION


This app allows us to convert an introduced value into seconds, minutes, hours and years and know the equivalent value between all of this fields and the value we entered at the beginning.

You will be able to change the value to convert whenever you want.
